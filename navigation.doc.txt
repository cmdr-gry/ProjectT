next time

I should keep trying to find necromancer githubs if I could find better one
I should do a git commit
Put something on smart contract and attach it to project file

Plan on how smart contract would interact with necromancer game, whats benefit for user?
What makes the game fun? etc.

I planned to have ziggurats which can be purchased if you have enough brains in the game. 
A new ziggurat would open up a new zone where the necromancer can go to infect humans.
Ziggurats would be the highscore for the necromancers and towers of control over the
zones.

New necromancers would start with 0 ziggurats, having to infect humans in smaller
villages. Ziggurats give access to control larger towns and cities. These ziggurats could be sold
for crypto or bought. Making the game P2E. 

The smart contract would be used to maintain record of highscores, to let users buy Ziggurats and transfer them
to other users. The game is developed by my company Tseppelin to separate website. 

I will need the working table to focus on making this game at home. I am getting
constantly distracted and that is a big problem for development.

Meanwhile, I can do the more minor tasks which dont demand too much time. 
---------------
for next time I could try to get this game work on a separate page on Tseppelin.io as a test, then remove it later from there.
I could also study the integration of brains in to a smart contract through web wallet interface.
Looking at the map of the game would be good too.
I need to push some web-related thing on the Github next time. Probably the main game page, 
but with web3 wallet bones if I am able to?
